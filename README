herp.pl uses parts of watch.pl (http://scripts.irssi.org)

Randomly replaces text sent by people/to channels in a list with nonsense words like "herp" and "derp"
Why use IGNORE when you can use HERP.PL and make them look even more retarded?

/herp in irssi for usage

/herp list - lists all derped channels and nicknames
/herp add <nick> - adds a nickname or channel
/herp del <nick> - removes a nickname from the list
/herp all - toggles herping of all names
